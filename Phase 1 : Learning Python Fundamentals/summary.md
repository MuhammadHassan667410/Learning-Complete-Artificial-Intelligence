# 🔹 Phase 1: Python & Math Foundations (Day 1–19)

Welcome to **Phase 1** of my  AI journey!  
In this phase, I focused on building the **fundamental skills** required for AI — including Python programming and essential mathematics (linear algebra, probability, and statistics).

## 🐍 Python Programming (Day 1–10)

Learned core programming skills in Python that form the foundation for machine learning and data science:

-  PANDAS, NUMPY, SEABORN, MATPLOTLIB
-  Variables, Data Types, Operators
-  Conditional Statements, Loops
-  Functions, Modules, Error Handling
-  Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
-  File Handling (CSV, Text)
-  Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

📁 Each day includes hands-on exercises and beginner-friendly mini projects.

## 📊 Math for AI (Day 11–19)

Built strong mathematical intuition to understand how ML algorithms work under the hood:

### 🧮 Linear Algebra
- Scalars, Vectors, Matrices
- Matrix Operations, Dot Product
- Transpose, Inverse, Identity
- Applications in ML

### 📈 Probability & Statistics
- Probability Basics, Bayes’ Theorem
- Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation
- Probability Distributions: Normal, Bernoulli, Binomial
- Correlation vs. Causation
- Z-scores & Outliers

## 🎯 Outcome of Phase 1

By the end of this phase, I was able to:
- Write Python code confidently
- Work with structured data (CSV files, lists, dictionaries)
- Understand how data is represented and manipulated using vectors and matrices
- Grasp the statistical principles that are used in model evaluation and learning
