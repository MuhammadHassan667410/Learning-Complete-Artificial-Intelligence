# 🖼️ Phase 5 – Computer Vision (Day 86–95)

This phase of my ** AI Learning Journey** is focused on **Computer Vision (CV)** – teaching machines to see, interpret, and understand the visual world.  

I’ll be following a structured path inspired by:  
- 📘 **Udemy – Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z**  
- 📘 **Udemy – Computer Vision Masterclass**
